Onion: 
Actor
The onion is the main characters. The onion gets activated at the beginning, we don't know why. Now that it's unfroozen it tries to escape the witches lair before it ends up in the cauldron!

It's possible the onion and the other vegetables are people or sentient creatures that got turned into vegetables. In that case maybe at the end they can go back to their normal forms.

Main enemy. The witch will not always be visible. She'll set up traps all over and you can see spells trying to stop the onion. May show up in person for the "boss battle".

Vegetables:
